 <h1>Common Types of Anemia</h1>   
 <p><span>Iron-deficiency anemia</span> is the most common type of anemia. It happens when you do not have enough iron in your body. Iron deficiency is usually due to blood loss but may occasionally be due to poor absorption of iron. Pregnancy and childbirth consume a great deal of iron and thus can result in pregnancy-related anemia.People who have had gastric bypass surgery for weight loss or other reasons may also be iron deficient due to poor absorption.</p>
<p><span>Vitamin-deficiency anemia</span> may result from low levels of vitamin B12 or folate (folic acid), usually due to poor dietary intake.Pernicious anemia is a condition in which vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p><span>Sickle cell anemia </span>is an inherited hemolytic anemia in which the hemoglobin protein is abnormal, causing the red blood cells to be rigid and clog the circulation because they are unable to flow through small blood vessels.</p>
